Just a basic monkey patch to give socks5 support to python sockets.


Usage:
Set the socks_proxy os environment variable.
Import it before anything else that will be using sockets.
If the environment variable isn't set, then no proxying will occur


Caveats:
only supports ipv4
only supports socks5
user/pass auth has not been tested
if socks_proxy env variable is set, all socket connections on that port will use it


Todo:
Add support for multiple ports/proxies
socks_proxy="<DESTPORT:>[username[:password]@]<PROXYHOST:><PROXYPORT> socks_proxy=<DESTPORT:>[username[:password]@]<PROXYHOST:><PROXYPORT> ..."
socks_proxy="<DESTPORT1,DESTPORT2,...,DESTPORTN:>[username[:password]@]<PROXYHOST:><PROXYPORT>"
